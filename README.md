# Synonyms for Geosearching

This repository contains synonyms and abbreviations in various languages 
to have better results when searching on locations, places, addresses and so on. 

Example: `avenue` <=> `av`, `ave` ... or `stra√üe`<=>`str`, `strasse`

Currently there are:
- Directionals (east <=> e)
- Place Names (department <=> dept)
- Streets (boulevard <=> blvd) 
- Countries (names, alpha-2, 3 and numeric)
- Personal titles (senior <=> sr)
- Punctuation (& <=> and)

## Usage
Synonyms are splitted by a comma `,` and a space ` `. 
To parse the synonyms you can get all `*.txt` files or only use specific folders and files and take each line as a synonym entry where you have to split by `, `.
We plan to add some utility packages in Golang and JavaScript.
